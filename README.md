### Projects
- **[Oizys](https://github.com/aBolondVarazslo/Oizys-Python)** — Custom programming language + interpreter. Focused on math parsing, variables, and factorials.
- **[ErisOS](https://github.com/aBolondVarazslo/ErisOS)** — Experimental OS built from scratch. Has a hand-rolled bootloader that enables the A20 line. Still early, breaks often.
- **[Python Port-Prober](https://github.com/aBolondVarazslo/Python-Port-Prober)** — Lightweight IP and port range scanner written in Python. Built to test quickly, not look pretty.

### Misc
- Open source, unfinished, mostly for learning
